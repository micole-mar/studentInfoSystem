# studentInfoSystem
simple student information system that helps me store and manage student data using Python and SQL. 

As I am a private tutor myself, I wanted to create a system that allows for efficient storage and management of my own student's data. As a tutor, I understand the importance of keeping organised records and staying on top of student information like their contact details. 

With my student info system, you can easily add, view, search, update and delete student records, ensuring that all necessary information is readily accessible. 

To further improve on this information management tool, I would like to build a user-friendly GUI to make it even more intuitive for users. With a GUI in place, users will have a more interactive and visually appealing way to interact with the system. I also plan to add functionality to allow tutors like myself to track their students' academic progress.
